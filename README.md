# VPN Proxy Server

This project is a simple VPN proxy server implemented in Python. It forwards traffic between a client and a destination server. This can be used to analyze network traffic or to create a basic VPN proxy.

## Features

- Forwards traffic between a client and a destination server.
- Can be used for network traffic analysis or as a simple VPN proxy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vpn-proxy-server.git
    cd vpn-proxy-server/vpn
    ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages (if any are needed):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming you have a requirements.txt file
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `main.py` file and modify the proxy server configuration and destination server configuration as needed:
    ```python
    proxy_host = '127.0.0.1'
    proxy_port = 8888
    destination_host = 'www.example.com'
    destination_port = 80
    ```

2. Run the proxy server:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The proxy server will start and listen for incoming connections on `127.0.0.1:8888`. It will forward traffic to the destination server configured in the script.
